As discussed, we have two running orders for this project.
We are delivering this completed 40% portion now, while the remaining work continues on the second order. 
Given the scope and quality requirements, we estimate needing approximately 10-12 additional days to complete 
the remaining features. We will be requesting a timeline extension for the continuing order to ensure we deliver
the same high-quality results.Please review the video update when convenient.

If you have any questions, feedback, or would like to discuss the next phase, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your understanding and continued trust in our work.
